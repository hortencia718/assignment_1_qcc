            <p><b>iceland</b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist.
                Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. 
                A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

                            Greek name for the northern wind, Boreas From september to april Iceland is a hot spot for this
                            magnificent light show.
                            The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural
                            phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the 
                            Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across
                            the skies.

                            When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's
                            namesake--namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is 
                            practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull
                            glaciers in the south of iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell)
